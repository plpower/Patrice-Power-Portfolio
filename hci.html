                <h4>Today’s technology allows humans to be more connected than ever, with social media and messaging platforms designed specifically for keeping us up to date on the lives of everyone including our most distant acquaintances. However, even with such amazing technology, people fail to set aside time to actually pick up the phone and call their loved ones</h4>
                <h4>With so many family members and friends to keep track of, people need assistance sorting which dates are important to remember, when birthdays are coming up, and what gifts are most meaningful to buy. In order to begin connecting one-on-one, people require reminders and organized profiles on their friends and family. Whether it’s due to busy schedules or laziness, people fail to practice regular communication with those who matter most and lack a technology that can reduce the number of obstacles to such interactions.</h4>
                <h1>Communication becomes especailly difficult for young adults and students.</h1>
                <h4>Young working adults or university students, are overwhelmed with their new environments and the stress that comes with work, homework, finding new friends, etc. While navigating a new world, it's difficult for these individuals to make time for their friends and family however near or far.</h4>

            <h2 class="mb-3">Design, test, repeat</h2>
            <h4>With an idea of the problem we hoped to solve, my team started by interviewing individuals in our target user demographic: students and adults between the age of 18 and 25. We called friends and family and interviewed other students on Northwestern's campus.</h4>
            <h4>Our target users <b>wanted</b> to find time to connect with other friends and family, but scheduling times to talk was tiresome and playing phone tag is discouraging.</h4>
            <h1>"2/3 of the time, I play phone tag and it doesn't work out."</h1>

            <h1>"I let messages build up, then call back when I have time."</h1>
            <h4 style="text-align:right">-User interview, 1/25/19</h4>
            <h4>Once we had enough research to begin designing, we created and tested our first paper prototype. One team member played 'computer,' changing screen views when the user interacted with our interface. The rest of us took notes, observed, and video taped (with permission). We gave our users a few tasks to complete to observe how easily and intuitively they were able to navigate our application. This helped us pinpoints weaknesses in our UI and understand how the application appears to new, unfamiliar users.</h4>

            <h4>One of the goals of this project was to practice designing for the user. By the conclusion of this project, which lasted about 12 weeks, we had conducted nine rounds of user testing and design iterations.</h4>

            <h2 class="mb-3">Design Principles</h2>
            <h4>This project gave my team members and me the opportunity come to a deeper understanding of the Norman and graphic design principles. We chose a few to focus on throughout the entire process. These principles were the at the forefront of our discussions when deciding on UI changes.</h4>
            <h4><b>Feedback:</b> Feedback is critical when developing a mobile application. Because users have no physcial buttons to interact with the app, feedback within the UI allows users to understand the app understands their actions and is working how they believe it should.</h4>
            <h4><b>Conceptual models:</b> When developing an app for users to help them save time and energy, the application must be easy enough to use that the users don't have to learn anything new. Thus, my team gave a lot of though to our target users's conceptual model of our application and its components. If our app fits their model, it shouldn't be difficult to pick up.</h4>
            <h4><b>Alignment:</b> My team wanted our application to have a clean and orderly feel. As Friendsy is a organizational app, we paid close attention to correct and simple alignment of our components.</h4>
            <h4><b>Repetition:</b> Repetition gives the user a sense of unity within an application. Since each member of my team was designing and coding our prototype, setting guidelines and rules around repetition of colors, indicators, buttons, and phrasing helped give our application a cohesive feel even when work was split among four members.</h4>

            <h4>The final application we created was called Friendsy. Friendsy is a social connections application which allows users to manage their meetings, phone calls, and important life events with the people they care most about. Our final prototype was built collectively by our team of four students in CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.</h4>
